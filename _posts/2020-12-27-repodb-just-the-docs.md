# RepoDB Documentation Site New Template

---

We are happily announcing the newly developed documentation site for [RepoDB](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB) library. The site is now running with [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) documentation theme for Jekyll.

Thank you to [Patrick Marsceill](https://twitter.com/pmarsceill) for continuously supporting this awesome template.

### Why did we change the template?

The new site is now having and capable of the following.

- Search capability of the modules
- Better experience and display to the other form factors (i.e.: Table and Mobile)
- Easy theme coloring updates
- Open-Source Support, we are leveraging

As you notice, the navigation bar is more intuitive than usual as the proper groupings were introduced in every module. In addition, the search on the top of the page shows the proper module as you input the letters. And many more, as we leveraged.

Though, we had optimized the content information of the site during the development, but, the details are still the same as the old one, these include the contents, contexts and even the links.

### Repository

The documentation site repository is hosted at Github ([RepoDB.NET](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB.NET)). You can submit a [new issue](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDB.NET/issues) if you found a problem on the content of the documentation, thus includes the sentences/paragraphs, grammars, code snippets and the images.

We hope that this new template will help you become producted with a better navigation to the proper modules.

As always, thank you to the community of .NET.
