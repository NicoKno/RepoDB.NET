Just today, July 12, 2020, I had published an article in Medium titled "Building a Better Hybrid Data Access Solution in .NET with Entity Framework + RepoDB".

In this article, I had explained the benefits of why combining Entity Framework with RepoDB to create a "hybrid solution" in .NET is "best" when addressing various business use-cases. After reading this article, you will most likely understand of "when" and "why" use RepoDB as part of your hybrid solution.

You can see the article from this [link](https://medium.com/@mikependon/building-a-better-hybrid-data-access-solution-in-net-with-entity-framework-repodb-d1039a648301?source=friends_link&sk=4913e4a8f493a1d3a12a18999a0a95a9).
