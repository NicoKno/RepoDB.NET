Just today, July 20, 2020, I had published an article in Medium titled "The Essentials of ORM Framework in your Software Development".

In this article, I had explained the core benefits and advantages of using an ORM. The intention is to persuade and help you (as a reader) decide to choose an ORM over writing your own fundamental implementation.

The article is divided into 3 parts. First, I will explain the basic benefits of an ORM. Secondly, I will explain the important factors for you to understand the edge advantages of using an ORM. Lastly, I will explain the lower-level technicalities of how the ORM works behind the scene. The article is targeting everyone, but the latter sections are quite important if you are a Developer and/or Software Architect.

You can see the article from this [link](https://medium.com/@mikependon/the-essentials-of-orm-framework-in-your-software-development-837131efd91b?source=friends_link&sk=1794cafbd289c19cebbe45cb77843a91).
