# DbHelperMapper

---

A mapper class for the [IDbHelper](/interface/idbhelper)-based class. The mapping can be made based on the type of the target RDBMS data provider. Please visit the [Database Helper](/extensibility/databasehelper) for more information.

### Methods

Below are the methods available from this class.

- `Add` - adds a mapping between the [IDbHelper](/interface/idbhelper) and the type of the `DbConnection`.
- `Clear` - clears all the mappings for the database helpers.
- `Get` - gets the mapped [IDbHelper](/interface/idbhelper) based on the type of the `DbConnection`.
- `Remove` - removed the mapping between the [IDbHelper](/interface/idbhelper) and the type of the `DbConnection`.

### Use-Cases

You should use this class if you would like to override the default mapping of the library when it comes to database helper.

### How to use?

To add a mapping, simply call the `Add()` method.

```csharp
DbHelperMapper.Add<SqlConnection>(new OptimizedSqlServerDbHelper(), true);
```

> An exception will be thrown if the mapping is already exists and you passed a `false` value in the `force` argument.

To get the mapping, use the `Get()` method.

```csharp
var helper = DbHelperMapper.Get<SqlConnection>();
```

To remove the mapping, use the `Remove()` method.

```csharp
DbHelperMapper.Remove<SqlConnection>();
```
