# PropertyHandler

This attribute is used to signal a property handling operation on the class property. By having this attribute, the library compiler (transformer) will automatically trigger the property handler `Get` and `Set` method for custom handling.

#### How to Use?

Let us say you have created a customized [IPropertyHandler](/interface/ipropertyhandler) like below.

```csharp
private class PersonAddressHandler : IPropertyHandler<string, Address>
{
	public Address Get(string input, ClassProperty property)
	{
		return JsonConvert.Deserialize<Address>(input);
	}

	public string Set(Address input, ClassProperty property)
	{
		return JsonConvert.Serialize(input);
	}
}
```

Then you can use this attribute to mark the class property to use the `PersonAddressHandler` property handler during the transformation.

```csharp
public class Person
{
	public long Id { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public int Age { get; set; }
	[PropertyHandler(typeof(PersonAddressHandler))]
	public Address Address { get; set; }
	public DateTime CreatedDateUtc { get; set; }
}
```

After that, when you read the records, you can automatically read the `Address` values from the `Address` property.

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString).EnsureOpen())
{
	var person = connection.Query<Person>(10045);
	Console.WriteLine($"Name: {person.Name}, Address: {person.Address.Street}, {person.Address.Region}, {person.Address.Country} ({person.Address.ZipCode})")
}
```

> The aim of this sample is to show that the property `Address` of the `Person` class is on type `NVARCHAR(MAX)` at the `[dbo].[Person]` table. In addition to this note, if this attribute is present on the property, then it ignores the automatic conversion of [TypeMapper](/mapper/typemapper#automatic) and enumerations.
